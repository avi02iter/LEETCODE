Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

//code

class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        while(true){
             int index=s.indexOf(part);  //it find the first occurence of the part
             int end=index+part.length()-1; // it means the part end at end index
             
             if(index==-1){
                   break;
               }
             //now remove the index to end part of part from the string
             s=s.substring(0,index)+s.substring(end+1);
               

        }
        return s;
         
    }
}
